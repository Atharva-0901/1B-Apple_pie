My approach:

I started with file to identify it as a 32-bit ELF binary with PIE enabled but not stripped
Using strings, I found interesting messages like 'You found the hidden treasure' which suggested hidden functionality as a string %S.
I ran the binary with ltrace to trace library calls, and immediately saw the password in plaintext. The program used strncmp to compare my input against "not_the_password", revealing the password without any reverse engineering needed.
With the correct password, the program still crashed on the second input - indicating a buffer overflow vulnerability
Using radare2, I discovered a function called 'def_nothing_important' that was never called in normal execution
Disassembling this function revealed it XOR-decoded several strings with the key 5, then printed them
I extracted the encoded strings and wrote a simple Python script to XOR-decode them, revealing the flag: gdg{P1E_3xpl01ted_lol}
